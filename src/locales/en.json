  "risk_msg2": "2. The settlement of the stability fee relies on the behavior of the mint, and there may be cases where the insurance pool fund does not get the average expected return. If no one settles the stability fee during the period of depositing the insurance fund, the insurance fund will have zero return in this period.",

  "risk_msg4": "There is a risk of liquidation in coinage. When the price of staked assets drops sharply, liquidation may be triggered. In addition, the stability fee will accumulate over time, which will increase Yourr collateral ratio and cause liquidation. Please pay attention to the collateral ratio and liquidation line in real time. After liquidation, Yourr staked assets cannot be retrieved. Please read carefully and understand the coin minting rules before proceeding.",
